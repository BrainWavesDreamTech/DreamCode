                        and the chance to be part of an exclusive, international investing program, investors
                        are once again falling prey to bogus "prime bank" scams. These fraudulent schemes
                        involve the purported issuance, trading, or use of so-called "prime" bank, "prime"
                        European bank or "prime" world bank financial instruments, or other "high yield
                        investment programs" ("HYIP"s). The fraud artists who promote these schemes often
                        use the word "prime" – or a synonymous phrase, such as "top fifty world banks" –
                        to cloak their programs with an air of legitimacy. They seek to mislead investors
                        by suggesting that well regarded and financially sound institutions participate
                        in these bogus programs. But prime bank and other related schemes have no connection
                        whatsoever to the world's leading financial institutions or to banks with the word
                        "prime" in their names. The Securities and Exchange Commission and <a href="http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/primebank/pbcont.shtml">
